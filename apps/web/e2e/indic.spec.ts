// Punjabi and Hindi, end to end — and the reason they get a file of their own
// rather than a row in language.spec.ts.
//
// Every non-Latin question this app had ever answered, it had answered for
// Arabic, and Arabic answers them all the same way: it is the only script that
// is not Latin AND the only script that is not left to right, so "which faces
// can set this language" and "which way does the page run" had one answer and
// were written as one condition. Gurmukhi and Devanagari split them. Each test
// below fails against the app as it was, for a reason the others cannot see:
//
//   1. the page mirrors        — an LTR language routed through the RTL branch
//   2. the face is Garamond    — `readerFace` asked `isRtl()`, Punjabi is not,
//                                so the reader is handed a face with no
//                                Gurmukhi glyph in it and the Bible renders
//                                from whatever the system happens to have
//   3. the picker offers five  — same condition, other side
//   4. search finds nothing    — the nukta a reader cannot reliably type
//   5. a cold device reads the KJV in fluent Punjabi
//
// The strings are read from the catalogues rather than typed, so this file does
// not become a second place the copy lives.
